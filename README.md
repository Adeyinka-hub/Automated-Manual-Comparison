# Manual vs Automated Feature Engineering with Featuretools Comparison 

All notebooks and code for the article: "Why Automated Feature Engineering
Will Change the Way You Do Machine Learning" on Towards Data Science (Link)

An expanded version of the article, "The Benefits of Automated Feature Engineering
for Predictive Modeling" is available on the Feature Labs Medium blog (Link)

The three projects are:

1. Loan Repayment Prediction: Data is from the Home Credit Default Risk
machine learning competition currently running on Kaggle. The objective is to 
predict whether or not a client applying for a loan will be able to repay the loan.

2. Engine Life Prediction: Adapted from a machine learning competition where
the objective is to determine how much longer an engine will run given operating
measurements. Data is simulated engine measurements from NASA.

3. Retail Spending Prediction: A set of online customer transactions, this data
initially did not come with a prediction problem. The task is framed as classifying
whether or not a customer will spend more than $500 in the next month.

## Running the notebooks

Make sure the appropriate data is in the `input` folder for each project and that 
the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` are installed. These projects require Python 3.6+.
